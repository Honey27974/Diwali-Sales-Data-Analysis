# 🎆 Diwali Sales Data Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs an end-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Diwali sales data using Python. The goal is to analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior during the festive season and extract insights that can help businesses improve sales strategies.

The analysis includes data cleaning, handling missing values, exploratory analysis, and visualization using real-world sales data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand customer purchasing behavior during Diwali
* Clean and preprocess raw sales data
* Remove null and unnecessary columns
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* Analyze sales across gender, age groups, states, and product categories
* Visualize insights using charts and graphs

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – Data cleaning & manipulation
* **NumPy** – Numerical operations
* **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
* **Seaborn** – Statistical data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

* Removed irrelevant columns (`Status`, `Unnamed1`)
* Checked and handled missing values
* Removed rows with null values in important columns
* Ensured data consistency before analysis

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following analyses were performed:

* Gender-wise purchasing behavior
* Age group vs total purchase amount
* State-wise sales analysis
* Occupation-based purchasing patterns
* Product category-wise sales distribution
* Top-selling product categories during Diwali

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included

* Bar plots for product category distribution
* Count plots for gender and age groups
* State-wise and occupation-wise sales charts

*(All visualizations are available inside the Jupyter Notebook)*
